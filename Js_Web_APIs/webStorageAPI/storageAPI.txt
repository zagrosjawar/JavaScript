Remember, Web APIs is the broader category that includes Browser APIs, which are specific to web browsers, as well as other web-related APIs.


Third: Web Storage API
----------------------

The Browser Storage API allows web applications to store data directly in the browser. 
This is particularly useful for saving user preferences, session information, or any other data that needs to persist across page reloads or sessions.

Types of Storage Objects
------------------------
1. localStorage Object
What: 
-The localStorage object provides access to the local storage of the browser for a particular Web Site. 
It allows you (website) to store, read, add, modify, and delete data items for that domain/origin.

-The localStorage object allows you to store data with no expiration date. 
This data will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Why Learn: Understanding localStorage is crucial for developing applications that need to remember user settings or data across sessions, enhancing user experience.
When to Use: Use localStorage when you need to store data that should persist between sessions (e.g., user preferences, theme settings).

2. sessionStorage Object
What: The sessionStorage object stores data for the duration of the page session. 
Data is cleared when the page session ends (e.g., when the browser tab is closed).

Why Learn: Knowing how to use sessionStorage is important for temporarily storing data that should not persist after the user closes the browser tab.

When to Use: Use sessionStorage for data that is relevant only for a single session 
(e.g., form data that should be retained if the user navigates back and forth within a single session).
