It is super important to know what is Web APIs?
API: API stands for Application Programming Interface, a set of rules and definitions that allow different software entities to communicate with each other.
(e.g, the communication between your webpage and browser's api or your web applicaton and wheather API to get weather data.)

Web API:
Web API: A Web API is an API specifically designed for web development. 
It provides a way for web applications to interact with web servers or other web-based services (like YouTube API).


Benifits
1. Web API can extend the functionality of the BROWSER.
2. Web API greatly simplify COMPLEX FUNCTIONS .
3. Web API provide easy SYNTAX to complex code.
... and more


You need to understand and remember this: Remember, Web APIs is the broader category that includes Browser APIs, which are specific to web browsers, as well as other web-related APIs.
So, it is appropriate to say "Browser APIs" when disscussing APIs that are built in Browsers.

But technically we use "Web APIs" ... the broader category.
For example, Web Forms API is the broader technical naming.
But, Browser Froms API indicates or means the same Forms APi,  but it is just being more specific. 

let us focus on Browser APIs
Browser APIs 
-----------
Definition: These are built into web browsers (your browser) and provide functionalities to enhance web applications directly within the browser environment.
Purpose: They allow web applications to interact with the browser and the userâ€™s device.
Examples:
Geolocation API: Retrieves the geographical location of the user.
DOM API (when you javascript manupulate html documents): Manipulates the Document Object Model, which represents the structure of a web page.

Fetch API: Provides a way to make network requests to retrieve resources (send and receive data).


Server APIs
-----------
Definition: These are used on the server side and provide functionalities to enhance the capabilities of a web server.
Purpose: They allow servers to perform operations such as database interactions, user authentication, and data processing.
Examples:
RESTful APIs: Use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
GraphQL APIs: Provide a more flexible way to query and manipulate data compared to RESTful APIs.



Third-party APIs: 
APIs provided by external service providers (free or payed) that allow developers to integrate functionalities or data 
from these external services into their own applications.

Examples:
YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.
Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.
Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.


Web APIs (APIs built in the browser) that we are going learn are : 
There are a lot of Browser APIs (ask chatGPT to list them all) but let us focus on these APIs:
1. Web Forms API
2. Web History API
3. Web Storage API
4. Web Worker API
5. Web Fetch API
6. Web Geolocation API
