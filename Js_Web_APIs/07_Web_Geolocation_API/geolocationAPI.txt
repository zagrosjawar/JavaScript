Remember, Web APIs is the broader category that includes Browser APIs, which are specific to web browsers, as well as other web-related APIs.

Sixth: Web Geolocation API (the last one in this tutorial):
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Web Geolocation API allows web applications to access the geographical position of a user.
Why is it useful?
his can be useful for a variety of applications, such as showing location-specific information, mapping services, or tracking movements in real-time.


The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user. Since this can compromise privacy, 
the position is not available unless the user approves it.

Note:
- Geolocation is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones.
- The Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts such as HTTPS.

1. How to Get User's Location?
 navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()

To get the user's current location, you can use the getCurrentPosition() method. 
This method returns the user's position as latitude and longitude coordinates.

navigator: is a global object that represents the state and identity of the user agent (the browser).
            It contains a variety of methods and properties related to the browser's capabilities and settings.

.geolocation: it is a property of the "navigator" object but it is at the same time an object.
              The geolocation object includes methods for retrieving the positon of the device.

Go through this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo">Click the button to get your coordinates:</p>

<button onclick="getLocation()">Try It</button>

<script>
const x = document.getElementById("demo");

function getLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {           // Check if Geolocation is supported
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition, showError);
  } else {
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}

function showPosition(position) {         // 'position' is the parameter
  x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
  "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}
</script>
</body>
</html>


Here:
position: is a parameter in the callback showPosition(position) function
          When .getCurrentPosition() is called and successfully retrieves the geographical location, 
          it passes a Position object to the showPosition function. 
          This Position object contains various properties about the geographical position (location data).

The "position" Object has:
"position.coords": An object containing the geographical coordinates and other related information. (it is a property of position at the same time)
        ".latitude": peroperty of ".coords" and contains the latitude of the position.
        ".longitude": peroperty of ".coords" and contains the longitude of the position.

        Other properties of "position.coords" are:
        .accuracy: The accuracy of the latitude and longitude coordinates.
        Other properties can include .altitude, .altitudeAccuracy, .heading, and .speed, if available.

"positon.timestamp": The time at which the position was retrieved.


You can update the callback function showPosition(position) to display the location on a Map using google maps API.


2. How to Track user location in Real-Time using Web Geolocation API?
   navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition, showError)

The .watchPosition() method returns the current position of the user and continues to return updated positions as the user moves (like the GPS in a car). 
This is particularly useful for applications that require real-time tracking.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo">Click the button to track your coordinates:</p>

<button onclick="startTracking()">Start Tracking</button>

<script>
const x = document.getElementById("demo");

function startTracking() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition, showError);    // .watchPosition() method
  } else {
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}

function showPosition(position) {
  x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
  "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>


Best Practices and Privacy Considerations
    Request Permission Responsibly: Always inform the user why you need their location and ask for their consent before accessing it.
    Use HTTPS: Ensure your site is served over HTTPS to use the Geolocation API.
    Handle Errors Gracefully: Provide meaningful messages if the location cannot be retrieved.
    Limit Location Requests: Only request the user's location when necessary and avoid excessive requests to preserve battery life on mobile devices.
