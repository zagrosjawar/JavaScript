What is db.json?
db.json is a simple JSON file that serves as a mock database for your project. 
It contains data in JSON format that json-server uses to create a RESTful API. 
This allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as if 
you were interacting with a real backend.


How to Check if json-server is Installed on your system:
    open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    json-server -v

If json-server is not installed:
    npm install -g json-server


How to Run json-server with db.json (to see updates in your db.json)
    1. Create Your db.json File (Already created)
    2. Navigate to Your Project Directory: cd path/to/your/project
    3. Run json-server:
        json-server --watch db.json

    4. Access the Mock API:
        http://localhost:3000/employees

    5. Challenge: if you want to PUT or DELETE an employee:
    write a new function for PUT request
    write a new function for DELETE request
    check employee "id" to choose correct automatically generated "id" to PUT or DELETE
    Use this url: http://localhost:3000/employees/{id}


if You see this erro: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
It means you did not run this command: json-server --watch db.json


Good Luck ;
